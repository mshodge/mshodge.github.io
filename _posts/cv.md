- Creating D3 visualisations for use in cross-government dashboards.
- Creation of a slack-bot system to create home-working tea-breaks between colleagues.
- Co-organiser of a cross-government data ethics and society working group.
- Writing technical blog posts for data science projects.
- One of the organisations geospatial experts, and lead a project to build and analyse public transport in the UK using R. This project also uses cloud computing infrastructure.
- Working with devolved Government on  a pipeline to automatically locate historical aerial images.
- I help build capability in data science within government branches by mentoring students on various projects. These have included using Neural Networks and Decision Trees. For these short-lived projects, we typically use Jupyter Notebooks to share code and display outputs.
- I setup and hold meetings with stakeholders to create new projects and collaborations between government branches.

### Data Scientist, May 2018 – October 2019

- I worked in a small team on a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that extracted key terminology from free text and forecasts emerging terms. For this, I used the Python. This project uses Neural Networks and Decision Trees.
- Many of my roles and responsibilities overlap with my current position as Senior Data Scientist.

### PhD Student, October 2014 – April 2018

- I researched earthquakes and fault systems in East Africa; how they develop and what the potential consequence of the earthquakes may be. This included a multi-disciplinary team of engineers, geologists, and local governments.
- I was the departments advisor and support for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle research.
- My work included the use of ‘Big Data’ datasets, including satellite imagery, UAV imagery and numerical modelling. 
- During this time, I gained expert knowledge of using Matlab, Python, R, VBA, ArcGIS and QGIS.

### Project Support Officer, November 2012 – October 2014				
- I was a project lead for an agri-environmental scheme. I supervised the workload of project employees and investigated any issues they experienced and, in collaboration, provided relevant and appropriate solutions.
- I maintained a superb standard of work to comply with statutory (devolved Government and European Union) directives.
- In order to do this, I established good working relationships with project clients and farmer unions.
- I produced technical customer reports, maps using ArcGIS, undertook project procurement, organised meetings and led training for new recruitments. 
- In addition, I developed a new centralised database to store current and future project data.
